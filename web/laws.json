Please understand that if it were not for his history of misdeeds i would not vote for this regardless of my opinions on his character. I only do so for the greater good.<br><br>What is the point of this nation, of this server? Well i believe it was created for some fun and entertainment- something to pass away boring school days and escape the harrowing reality we live in today. Unfortunately Luke does not quite understand that. Does not understand the strange realness of this creation. Does not understand the rest of us and only wishes for destruction and chaos. He literally admitted it immediately to us all. I believe that for the greater good and enjoyment of the nation, Twaddle should step down from the politics of the server. This does not mean he is not a part of it or has any less right than anyone else. It simply balances the server out and restores democracy.<br><br>When I refer to \"the greater good\" i simply mean that following previous cheeseland establishments, Twaddle has proven himself to be disruptive politically and ruining enjoyment for everybody else by taking the nation down. It is not harsh to relieve him of political duties so that everyone, including himself, can enjoy themselves.<br><b>Xohng Xina and De Wok</b>So with this in mind, i now invite all to partake in this vote. I invite those who initially thought against to reconsider. To amend their rigidness and stubborness so they can be more liberal and open minded. I even invite Twaddle himself to rethink. Do you really want to cause chaos and disruption in your own selfish enjoyment or let the flow of the server continue? Why are you doing this? Just to spite me, just to annoy everyone, just to be \"the best and most powerful\". Maybe you might even want to step down. Maybe you may prefer to focus on your business.
